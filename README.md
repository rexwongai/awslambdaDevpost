Real - time Sales Insights Engine-2025
Real-time E-commerce Sales Analysis Platform
For the pain points of the e - commerce industry, I designed a "Real - time Sales Insights Engine" which can:
Process order data in real - time and generate analysis reports.
Automatically detect sales anomalies and trigger alerts.
Provide data visualization and predictive analysis.
Support the integration of multi - channel sales data.
This solution combines the event - driven characteristics of Lambda and multiple AWS services, and can solve the practical problems faced by e - commerce enterprises.
Solution Highlights
Event - Driven Architecture:
Trigger the order - processing Lambda function using API Gateway
Trigger the daily analysis report generation on a schedule via EventBridge
Multi - AWS Service Integration:
Store order data in DynamoDB
Store analysis reports and charts in S3
Send alerts and report notifications via SNS
Execute core business logic with Lambda
Business Value
Monitor large - value orders in real - time and promptly identify high - value customers.
Automatically generate daily sales reports to save time on manual analysis.
Data visualization helps enterprises quickly grasp sales trends.
The scalable architecture supports business growth.
Deployment and expansion suggestions:
Deployment steps:
Use the AWS SAM CLI to build and deploy the infrastructure.
Configure SNS subscriptions to receive alerts and reports.
Integrate into the existing e - commerce system.
Possible expansion directions:
Add machine - learning prediction models (using SageMaker or Bedrock).
Achieve multi - channel data integration (such as social media, etc.).
Develop custom dashboards (using QuickSight).
Add an anomaly detection algorithm to automatically identify abnormal sales.
This solution meets the requirements of the competition, is innovative and practical, and also demonstrates your in - depth understanding and comprehensive application ability of AWS services. Remember to elaborate on your design ideas, business value, and technical implementation details when submitting. This will help improve your competition results.
